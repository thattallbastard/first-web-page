First page created from a mock up

Not much to see here. I'm just starting out learnig both Git and Web development, so I've created a web page from a given mock up.  Included on the page is the given mock up, so that differences can be spotted.  The mock up was created  for 1024px, the the browser must be sized accordingly in order to be viewed properly.  The page was created with the use of the Bootstrap framework.  If you're taking a look, thanks for stopping by.  I'll have more to come.
